# Hamara Virsa - Book Launch Website

This repository contains the files for a simple, single-page static website for the book launch event of "Hamara Virsa". The website is designed to be hosted using GitHub Pages.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website's content.
- `css/style.css`: The stylesheet for the website's design.
- `images/`: A folder to store images. You should place the invite-01.jpg flyer here.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Add Files: Make sure all the files (index.html, the css folder with style.css, and the images folder with your flyer) are committed and pushed to the main branch of your GitHub repository

2. Enable GitHub Pages:
    - Go to your repository on GitHub: github.com/talsiddiqui/hamara-virsa.
    - Click on the Settings tab.
    - In the left sidebar, click on Pages.
    - Under "Build and deployment", for the Source, select Deploy from a branch.
    - For the Branch, select main and keep the folder as / (root).
    - Click Save.

3. View Your Site: GitHub will generate your website. It might take a few minutes. The URL for your live site will be displayed on the Pages settings screen, typically in the format https://talsiddiqui.github.io/hamara-virsa/.

That's it! Your website will be live.
